Big Earl exists to help trim the fat from long URLs, making them easier and safer to share with others:

* Provides short alphabetic codes that redirect to the original URL

* Available through a JSON web service or web app

* Preview link destinations before navigating to unknown destinations

* No tracking of link usage, so you can privately use Big Earl links
